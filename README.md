# BetCoin
Blockchain-based platform for creating polls, voting on polls, and betting on the outcome of polls. Created as a final project for Blockchain Solution Development, an elective course of the MSITM program at UT Austin's McComb's School of Business

The frontend is currently nonfunctional, but work-in-progress code has been uploaded. The smart contract is functional but contains numerous security concerns and is only intended to serve as a proof-of-concept
