# BetCoin
Blockchain-based platform for creating polls, voting on polls, and betting on the outcome of polls. Project created as a final project for Blockchain Solution Development, an elective course of the MSITM program at UT Austin's McComb's School of Business

The BetCoin smart contract is purely a proof-of-concept development and does not include all the necessary security measures required for a full-scale deployment
